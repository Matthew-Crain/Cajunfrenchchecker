# Cajunfrenchchecker
For the purpose of this document Cajun and Louisiana French (LF) are interchangable 

The goal of this project is to develop a widget where English and French words can be inserted into a search bar and be provided the cajun french word or varient spellings and vice versa

The first step will to be to make a small database with a small database for testing with 3 words
1. electricity (has many spelling varients in Louisiana French)
2. entendre
3. attendre
4. esperer
5. essayer
(Thank you to Louisianish from the Cajun French discord)

The second step will be to connect this database to the internet and make sure it's acceassable 

The third step will be to write a java program to read the database
